# Interacting with R

## I am adding 3 and 5. R is fun!

x <- 3
y <- 10
y
x + y

number <- x + y

# Try changing the value of x to 5, what happens to number?
x <- 5
# After changing the value of x to 5, number changed from 8 to 10

# Now try changing the value of variable y to contain the value 10, update the variable number also
# Changed variable y to the value of 10 and re-ran the variable number, ended up with output of 15

# Create a numeric vector and store the vector as a variable called 'glengths'

# Create a character vector and store the vector as a variable called 'species'

# Create a character vector and store the vector as a variable called 'expression'

# When you use the rownames() function on metadata, what is the data structure of the output?
